			<p class="__fcvip">Branding and Logo Design</p>
			<button class="__accordion">How long does a logo design take?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  	<p>The turnaround time for a logo from concept to completion is typically 72hrs, which will be discussed before any payments are made. Timescales are also dependent on response time, and any additional changes to designs.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="__accordion">When and how do I pay for the work?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  	<p>We’ll get started with a no obligation phone call. If we’re the right fit for you, we’ll send a project contract for you to sign. We’ll send your first invoice (50% of the project fee) once we receive your contract. Once we’ve locked in your logo concept together, we’ll send the final 50% invoice.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="__accordion">How many logos do I get?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  	<p>Following the design phase, you will be presented with 2 logo concepts based upon agreed objectives. Once final payment has been made, you will own the copyright to the final agreed design.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="__accordion">What if I want to make a change to a logo?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  	<p>That's no problem at all.</p>
			  	<p>When the first set of designs are presented to you, you will have the opportunity to provide feedback and request modifications if required.</p>
			  	<p>However, up to 2 revision rounds are included within the typical project scope. In the unlikely event that additional revisions are required beyond this, you will be charged at a cost of $5 per revision round, and will be added onto the final invoice</p>
			</div>

			<button class="__accordion">Can I request more than two logo concepts?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  	<p>We include two logo concepts as standard in our bundles because we’re confident that our discovery workshop has given us a solid handle on your brand. But of course, we can design more options if you need them at a small additional cost.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="__accordion">Are my logo concepts original or pre-made designs?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  	<p>All logos are completely custom-designed, in line with your brand’s specific vision and needs. We don’t do “cookie cutter” designs, or variations on the same idea again and again. We follow your lead to create logo concepts that set you apart from the competition. We don’t believe in second-rate design and never create designs we’re not proud of.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="__accordion">What happens if I’m not happy with my logo concepts?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  	<p>Our research and planning phase is thorough – this means we’re on the same page as you from the beginning. We'll jump on a call, and we'll work together to establish what's not working, why, and we'll work out a direction so we can proceed with the project.</p>
			  	<p>It's worth noting that the designs presented to you will be based on goals agreed with you before the design phase begins. This will include information about your business, competition and target audience. It will also include any specific requirements or expectations you may have, so this is an unlikely scenario.</p>
			  	<p>We focus our design decisions on goals, which we will explain when presenting the designs. This will mean we have considered your business, target audience and competition. As a logo is a strategic tool it doesn’t need to be liked by you personally, but should instead perform for your business, and this is something we will discuss with you.</p>
			  	<p>We will cooperate with you throughout the project to ensure the design achieves all goals agreed upon, which will include any specific requests made before starting the designs.</p>
			  	<p>So if you’re not satisfied we’ll revisit, revise and keep going until you’re proud of the result.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="__accordion">When can I start using my brand logo?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  	<p>You can start using your brand logo as soon as you get the vector logo files. These files are ideal for use in the following manners to build and amplify your brand message:</p>
			  	<ol type="a">
			  		<li>PNG logo for branding website, social media header, and packaging designs.</li>
			  		<li>PDF logo for printing business card, letterhead design, or flyer design.</li>
